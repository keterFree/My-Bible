### Research Area:
**Exploratory Study on the Application of AI in Detecting and Mitigating Fake News on Social Media**


### Problem Statement:  
The proliferation of social media platforms has revolutionized how information is disseminated, but it has also led to the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation, commonly referred to as "fake news." This phenomenon poses significant challenges to journalism, freedom of expression, and democratic stability. Despite the increasing use of AI models to detect fake news, the complexities surrounding their application across diverse content types (text, images, and videos), languages, and topics are not fully understood. The recent emergence of sophisticated techniques such as deepfakes has further complicated fake news detection, enabling the creation of misleading and highly realistic content that can evade traditional detection methods. Furthermore, AI itself plays a dual role in this domainâ€”acting both as a defensive tool for detecting fake news and as a weapon that can be exploited to create and propagate it. This exploratory study seeks to investigate these complexities by identifying key factors that influence the effectiveness of AI-based fake news detection models, evaluating the dual role of AI in cybersecurity, and proposing hypotheses for advancing research in this critical area.


### Main Objective:  
To explore the effectiveness and limitations of AI techniques in detecting and mitigating fake news on social media across different content types and formats, while examining the dual role of AI in cybersecurity.


### Specific Objectives:
1. **To identify and analyze the limitations of current fake news detection techniques, including their effectiveness across various languages, topics, and content formats (text, images, and videos).**

2. **To explore the dual role of AI in cybersecurity: as both a defense mechanism for detecting fake news and as a tool that can be exploited to create, spread, and enhance malicious content, such as deepfake and synthetic media.**

3. **To assess the impact of deepfake and synthetic media on the detection of fake news and evaluate the capabilities of current AI models in handling such complex scenarios.**

4. **To propose hypotheses and potential research directions to address the identified gaps, including developing multi-modal AI models, integrating adversarial learning, and exploring new strategies to enhance detection resilience and adaptability.**


This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of AI-based fake news detection methods, highlight the dual role of AI in cybersecurity, and suggest future research directions to develop more robust and effective models for combating the spread of misinformation on social media.
